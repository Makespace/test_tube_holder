# Test Tube Holder

Makespace was asked by the University of Cambridge and the Institute for Manufacturing to assist in the design and manufacture of test tube holders in support of Weekly asymptomatic screening programme for COVID-19 at the University of Cambridge.

In the screening programme the students use a swab to take a sample from their nose and throat. Swabs are pooled by household, enabling the University to reduce the number of tests required to around 2,000 per week.   A sample holder was needed which could be distributed as part of the testing kits. Cost and simplicity were important. 

Design and prototyping took a few calls and an afternoon at the laser cutter.  Within a week production had started.

The programme has distributed over 3,000 stands to be used by approximately 16,000 students. To date the stands have supported approximately 5000 pooled tests.   

Makespace is pleased to help the University look after the students and the Cambridge Community.
